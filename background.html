    <h1 class="titleText">Story</h1>
    <p>You are haunted by something so terrible that you dare not speak of it.
    You’ve tried to bury it and run away from it, to no avail. Whatever this
    thing is that haunts you can’t be slain with a sword or banished with a
    spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling
    nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark.
    The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from most people and making you
    question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys
    you. Kaisen faces whispers of voices of the Crossed he killed, betrayed to
    be harvested by one of their own. He disrupted their processes. Also faces
    dreams with messages of Brand.</p>

    <h1 class="titleText">What's Affected:</h1>

    <h2 class="titleText">Heart of Darkness</h2>
    <p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable
    horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you,
    commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you.
    Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take
    up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy
    alone.<br />
